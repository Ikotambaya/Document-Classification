Comparative Analysis of Traditional and Deep Learning Approaches for Document Classification using the 20 Newsgroups Dataset
Overview
This repository presents a comparative analysis of traditional machine learning and deep learning models for text classification using the 20 Newsgroups dataset. The study evaluates the effectiveness of Naive Bayes (NB), Support Vector Machine (SVM), Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), and their hybrid versions, including BiLSTM with Attention and CNN-GRU with Attention Mechanism and Gradient Clipping.
The models are assessed based on performance metrics such as accuracy, F1 score, PR-AUC, ROC-AUC, and precision-recall curves. The 20 Newsgroups dataset serves as the benchmark, containing documents from 20 categories like science, politics, technology, and religion.
